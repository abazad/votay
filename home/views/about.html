    Votay was started because of <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine (GAE)</a>. GAE is amazing.  It runs on thousands of servers managed by Google virtually guaranteed to be working perfectly 24/7.  Because it runs on thousands of servers if any one server fails, no sites go down.  And if any one site gets more traffic than one server can handle, other servers are used and the site works perfectly.  There is another very good open source blogging software package called <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a>.  But it will not run on GAE because it requires hosting with PHP and a MySQL database.

    <p>
    In addition to how amazing GAE is because it lets any site scale from one user to millions of users without any extra work on your part, it's amazing the price Google charges.  If you stay within the free limits, it's totally free.  And the free limits are <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html">very big</a>.

    Votay is a work in progress.  You can get the <a href="http://github.com/andrewarrow/votay">source code</a> from github.
